# Project---Clustering

# Project Goal
We will conduct an in depth analysis of Zillow property data from 2017. We will use exploratory analysis and clustering techniques to identify the key drivers of error in Zillow's predictions, then use machine learning algorithms to create a model capable of predicting the error
