# Project---Clustering

# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to identify factors affecting errors in the Zestimate used by Zillow to estimate single family home prices in 2017. The results of this project will be used to improve the model used to estimate prices and guide future data collection efforts


# Project Description
We will conduct an in depth analysis of Zillow property data from 2017. We will use exploratory analysis and clustering techniques to identify the key drivers of error in Zillow's predictions, then use machine learning algorithms to create a model capable of predicting the error. If we know log errors are higher for certain home characteristics, we can investigate the reasons for higher errors, develop a mitigation plan, and improve model predictions. We used statistical testing, clustering and regression methods to provide insight into what affects log error.
